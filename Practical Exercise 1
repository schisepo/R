- getwd() : Get Working Directory
- File -> New Project -> 
- its best practise to create a seperate folder for data
- ctrl + enter = Run script line by line
- if you are sourcing stuff in, you need to embed command in a Print statement
- ?names - Opena help file... alternative is help(names)
- R is inteprative rather than compilative, doesnt compile like SAS

## Get Help

- type r-help matrix multiplication 
____________________________________________

- setwd("path to project")

Equal to : ==
Not equal to: !=
Equal to one in list: %in%
and : &
or : |

## Data Types

Vectors
Daat Frames
Lists
Matrices
Custom objects i.e. object-orientation e.g. Summary function

## Sub-setting vectors
runif - random uniform

## Vector subsetting

head() - first 6
tail() - last 6
x[1] - 1st value
head(x,1)
x[50:60] - values at index 50 to 60
x[x>0.5] - get values greater than 0.5
y<-x[x<=0.5] - assign to y all values in x less than or equal to 0.5


##Vectorization

(y) - prints out

## Data frames

-similiar to SQL Table, can have columns of different types

df<- data.frame(a=letters,b=runif(26))
str(df) - gives you structure of the data frame
R uses Row X Column for indexing
R scripts define a workflow
